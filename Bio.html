        <span>Hi</span>
        <p>My name is Dhulfiqar Hussein, I'm pursuing a major in Information Systems at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. I'm graduating in the fall of 2023. Prior to enrolling in ENGL 393 Technical Communication, I had little awareness of the immense significance that technical communication holds for my future career. This course has enlightened me about conveying information and messages effectively to specific targeted groups. Moreover, I have realized that technical communication transcends boundaries and empowers me to create logical and engaging content, irrespective of the field I write for. This class has truly broadened my perspective on the multifaceted nature of writing and its impact.</p>

        <span>Additionally</span>
        <p>I am thrilled to embark on the journey of creating my digital portfolio for this technical communication class. My goal is to construct a website that not only showcases my growth and learning in this field but also serves as a powerful tool to promote myself for future internships, jobs, or related opportunities.</p>
