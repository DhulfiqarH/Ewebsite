        <span>Pear Review</span>
        <p>As part of the assignment, students were tasked with sharing rough drafts of their major assignments for peer critique. This exercise aimed to provide an opportunity to evaluate and provide constructive feedback on the varying levels of writing displayed by fellow students, focusing on areas that required improvement.</p>

        <span>Nominalization</span>
        <p>
Nominalization involves transforming verbs or adjectives into nouns, which can complicate your writing. It is important to recognize and revise instances of nominalization to maintain clarity and effectiveness in your language. Rather than unnecessarily converting words into nouns, it is often preferable to use the original verb or adjective for stronger impact.</p>

        <p>The assignment challenges the notion of formal versus informal writing by presenting formality as a spectrum influenced by various factors such as audience, genre, purpose, and topic.</p>

        <p>Through engaging in peer reviews, I have gained valuable insights into the art of receiving and implementing constructive feedback to enhance my writing. Evaluating my classmates' work has granted me a deeper understanding of their writing styles and approaches, prompting me to critically analyze their arguments and intentions rather than merely focusing on grammar. Moreover, I have drawn inspiration from their writing techniques, incorporating effective strategies into my own work. The provided question prompts have empowered me to develop personalized templates for future peer reviews, with the aim of delivering insightful feedback that facilitates meaningful growth for my peers.</p>

        <span>Reflection</span>
        <p>
Nominalization has taught me the significance of clear and concise writing. It was initially easy to understand but challenging to identify and revise in practice. I now recognize the importance of balancing nouns with other parts of speech for effective communication. This awareness enables me to improve the clarity and impact of my writing by avoiding unnecessary nominalization.</p>

        <span>&nbsp;</span>
        <p>
The assignment taught me that formal and informal writing are not inherently right or wrong, but depend on the rhetorical context. It emphasized the importance of appropriateness and the complementarity of both styles within a text. This insight has made me more aware of the expectations and balance between formality and informality in professional and academic writing.</p>
